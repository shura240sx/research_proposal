        I want to study and understand how a specific community feels about the accessibility points within unremodeled historical buildings to gather the context of making a plan to alter the facades for a wider range of accessibility. There are a handful of existing studies that focus on the issue of historical buildings and accessibility points. To begin, the article “<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/603/5/052007" target="_blank">Historical Buildings and the Issue of Their Accessibility for the Disabled</a>” by Dominika Kusnierz-Krupa talks about a palace in Poland that has a very significant historical value for its community. The accessibility within the palace, however, has barriers for those with disabilities. Due to this, a proposal for a passenger lift to be installed within the palace was made by the community. As the palace is run by conservators who “often support themselves with conservator opinions” (Kusnierz-Krupa 4), Kusnierz-Krupa discusses that this is an obstacle to overcome within itself. Kusnierz-Krupa states that the opinions of the conservators stem from the palace having “an outstanding work of architecture and an extraordinarily precious monument of national culture" (4); because of this, "the construction of the passenger lift in question was to be performed in such a manner as to minimize its negative impact and influence on the cultural values of this historical building” (4). In this article, Kusnierz-Krupa focuses on the <i>interior</i> of the palace and how it holds so much historical significance that it is very difficult to implement a change for the social aspect.

The article “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10694-010-0199-0" target="_blank">How Do People with Disabilities Consider Fire Safety and Evacuation Possibilities in Historical Buildings?—A Swedish Case Study</a>” written by Kecklund Lena, Andrée Kristin, Bengtson Staffan, Willander Sara, and Siré Elena talks about emergency evacuation safety within historical buildings and touches on possible safety enhancing measures to accommodate for the needs of people with disabilities. In historical buildings, not every evacuation route could be trusted as accessible. It is touched on that obstacles were in the way of these evacuation routes, making it difficult for those with physical disabilities and wheelchair users to get through. Visually impaired persons also “reported difficulties in opening doors and windows along the escape routes as well as maneuvering opening devices” (Kecklund et al. 36). It is addressed that “the cultural qualities of the building are preserved and protected. The risk of destroying a building’s historical value by carrying out different accessibility or evacuation safety measures was brought to light" (Kecklund et al. 38-39). As a whole, Kecklund et al. discuss that even if it is for the improvement of evacuation safety for those who are disabled, the historical qualities of these buildings should not be extensively affected.

Lastly, “<a href="https://ajod.org/index.php/ajod/article/view/33" target="_blank">Impact of Inaccessible Spaces on Community Participation of People with Mobility Limitations in Zambia</a>” written by Martha Banda-Chalwe, Jennifer C. Nitz, and Desleigh de Jonge touches on the rights for humans to have accessibility to mobility and building access points. They discuss that accessibility to general buildings in Zambia is very difficult; there were attitudinal barriers and discriminations towards accessibility implementation as buildings were designed for the “preferred lifestyle”. This article as a whole takes a step away from the focus on the historical values of buildings that stand in the way of change and shifts the attention towards the unjust attitudes of which are the backbone of a city's general buildings. </div>

Though these background studies do touch on some qualitative data and qualitative aspects of my proposal, they are missing the conversation about the facades of multiple historical buildings within the context of a city. The conversation is mostly about the architecture and preserving the historical value of the buildings and their ornamentation. Two articles just touch on historical buildings, but with regards towards either evacuation problems or historical perseverance of a building. The other article (Zambia) touches on ADA accessibility changes for all buildings in the city rather than just historical ones.  I want to study not just one inaccessible building in particular that has a historical significance – I want to focus on a collection of buildings that are inaccessible. I want to study how a community feels about their historical buildings and understand their inputs, agreements, disagreements and concerns about the proposed idea that I have. Unresolved is the context of making a plan to alter multiple historical buildings in a city for wider accessibility purposes.
