       “Historical Buildings and the Issue of Their Accessibility for the Disabled” talks about a palace in Poland that has a very significant historical value for its community. The palace is run by  conservators who “often support themselves with conservator opinions” (4). There is “an outstanding work of architecture and an extraordinarily precious monument of national culture. Therefore, the construction of the passenger lift in question was to be performed in such a manner as to minimize its negative impact and influence on the cultural values of this historical building” (4). This article focuses on the interior of the building and how the palace holds so much historical significance that it is very difficult to implement a change for the social aspect.
“How Do People with Disabilities Consider Fire Safety and Evacuation Possibilities in Historical Buildings?—A Swedish Case Study” talks about emergency evacuation safety within historical buildings and touches on possible safety enhancing measures to accommodate for the needs of people with disabilities. In historical buildings, not every evacuation route could be trusted as accessible. It is touched on that obstacles were in the way of these evacuation routes, making it difficult for those with physical disabilities and wheelchair users to get through. Visually impaired persons also “reported difficulties in opening doors and windows along the escape routes as well as maneuvering opening devices” (36). It is addressed that “the cultural qualities of the building are preserved and protected. The risk of destroying a building’s historical value by carrying out different accessibility or evacuation safety measures was brought to light during one of the focus group interviews. Therefore it is important to develop and provide measures to improve evacuation safety that will not have an extensive effect on the building” (38-39).
“Impact of Inaccessible Spaces on Community Participation of People with Mobility Limitations in Zambia” touches on the rights for humans to have that accessibility to mobility and building access points. Accessibility to general buildings in Zambia was very difficult; there were attitudinal barriers and discriminations towards accessibility implementation as they were designed for the “preferred lifestyle”. This article, however, does not focus primarily on historical buildings and the historical values of them that stand in the way of change.</div>

  What is unresolved?

Though these background studies do touch on some qualitative data and qualitative aspects of my proposal, they are missing the conversation about the facades of multiple historical buildings within the context of a city. The conversation is mostly about the architecture and preserving the historical value of the buildings and their ornamentation. Two articles just touch on historical buildings, but with regards towards either evacuation problems or historical perseverance of a building. The other article (Zambia) touches on ADA accessibility changes for all buildings in the city rather than just historical ones.  I want to study not just one inaccessible building in particular that has a historical significance – I want to focus on a collection of buildings that are inaccessible. I want to study how a community feels about their historical buildings and understand their inputs, agreements, disagreements and concerns about the proposed idea that I have. Unresolved is the context of making a plan to alter multiple historical buildings in a city for wider accessibility purposes.
