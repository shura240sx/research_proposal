     Methods
   </div>
  
     <div class="firstp">
      The general methodology I chose to use for my study to test my hypothesis are:
      <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Interviews</li>
          <li>Participant Surveys</li>
          <li>Observations</li></b>
        </ul>
       <br>These qualitative methods are necessary to conduct as they use direct human interaction to bring opinions, first-hand accounts, stories and feelings to the forefront and strengthen the outcome of the study. With <u>interviews</u>, I will be able to listen to the concerns of the participants, analyze them, and apply them to the study to demonstrate why my research is important. With <u>participant surveys</u>, they will allow for anonymous applications where people can submit their opinions and concerns -- eliminating the publicizing of their names. These surveys will provide both qualitative and quantitative data that I will be able to use as statistics to strengthen my research. Lastly, <u>Observations</u> will allow me to describe and write down first-hand accounts of people utilizing the facades of these sets of buildings. By observing the building sites, I will be able to take note of how these facades are used, study human interactions and reactions, and also decide when and who I choose as interview participants. Not only this, but I will be able to provide a quantitative count of how many people enter through the front doors and how many enter through ramps to study which entrance is most commonly used.
<br>
       <br>
 There will be a variety of participants that I will be testing. Firstly, I will be studying the residents who are currently living in Oregon City at the time of my research, un-exclusionary to their age, race, genders, and able-bodiedness. This way, I will be open to the thoughts and opinions of all people with all bodies. These residents will provide crucial first-hand accounts and opinions to my research, as they are the primary group of people that could know about the accessibility impacts of the buildings I am studying. My intentions with contacting these residents are to email out my survey questionnaires to collect both qualitative and quantitative data, as well as permissibly interviewing the residents through acceptance via the questionarre. Secondly, I will be visually observing any and all of the people that are interacting with the buildings, regardless of their age, race, genders, and able-bodiedness. By doing so, I will be able to recruit <i>all </i> individuals for my study as well as intervene and verbally contact them for a possible interview. These interviews will be very beneficial to my research, as the participants are real-time active users of the buildings and could provide their thoughts and opinions. 
<br>
       <br>
There will be a great emphasis on studying people of all ages, races, genders, and able-bodiedness. This is to ensure that any and all opinions and thoughts are heard, as anybody can experience difficulty with the interaction of a building. This is also to eliminate an unethical approach of personally deeming who and who is not susceptible to experiencing difficulties with a building; I want to ensure that I do not define bodies as able or disabled without understanding how the individual identifies themselves first. If they do not identify themselves as one or the other, I will not be choosing for them and will describe their data through observational notes.

<div id="secondp">
The kinds of variations that I would make in order to test my hypothesis is through the process of studying and interviewing people of different ages and able-bodiedness. By doing so, I will be able to collect a diverse understanding of ways people use the entry points of the facades and their experiences with them. With variations being made in regards to survey questionnaires, the content within them will remain the same for every participant. I will provide a brief introduction to the project, a short survey including up to 10 questions with a combination of multiple choice, and short answer questions. At the end of the survey, I will also provide an encouraging option for participants to follow up with the survey through a personal interview. This is to ensure consistency within the data gathering and the grouping of the results in future analysis. With regards to variations within interviewing my participants, their age and able-bodiedness will somewhat dictate the set of questions I ask. All participants will be under control of the same set of questions for better comparison in results. Participants that identify as able-bodied will receive a set of short and understandable questions that ask them on their thoughts and experiences with the building as a whole. By getting on the individualâ€™s level, this will establish a good rapport; the age of the participants must be encountered for, and speaking with mindfulness of comprehension levels will be necessary. When that is ensured, a set of easy questions will be introduced towards the facades and entry points of the buildings to guide into conversation about personal experiences with them. After doing so, I will question the individuals to understand their opinions on potential reconstruction of the facades. 
<br>
<br>
Participants that identify as disabled will undergo the same procedure, but will have a set of questions that personally ask them how their disabilities have limited their experiences with the building. Building rapport will be crucially important, as they will be faced with sharing personal experiences about the disability that they have. I will have to be aware and respectful to their feelings and comfortability, tending to the way that the conversation is going and choosing the proper way to converse.
<br>
<br>
By varying these factors, I will then be able to better confirm or disconfirm my hypothesis as I will have a better understanding of the way that the current facades and potential changes to them could affect individuals both physically and emotionally. By interviewing different ages and able-bodiedness, I will be able to determine whether or not the facades of historical buildings obstruct accessibility for a wide spectrum of people. I will also be able to test how individuals feel about introducing change to the set of historical and preserved buildings. 
  <br>
<br>
I assume that my hypothesis will both be confirmed and disconfirmed as the answers I will be studying for are driven by the personal opinions and accounts of the participants. Confirming my hypothesis would be the qualitative data on the troubled experiences of bodies with historical building entry points. Long-time and elderly residents of Oregon City, though, may be opposed to changes and improvements made to the facades of these historical buildings. As this possible outcome could disconfirm my hypothesis, I will still be able to address this as an issue through the other data gathered that would confirm my hypothesis and compare it to each other. 
<br>
  <br>
The factors that I would need to control for in my study is the time of days I arrive at each building (their busiest hours to see how accessibility functions best). I also need to control for interview interruptions; for example, when observing the interactions with the church, I need to make sure that I will be approaching and interviewing participants in a timely and undisturbing manner. I would also need to control the questions I ask, maintaining a similar set of them with each participant to ensure a consistency in data gathering.
<br>
  <br>
The types of effects that would be likely to occur that appear to confirm hypothesis:
Evidence through clear communication on how the facades impact accessibility and mobility for individuals.
Evidence through storytelling that describes a moment in which there was a troublesome encounter with accessibility; this is not limited to stair-only facades â€“ it also includes having to take alternate routes or entering the building from a non-prominent side. 
Observed interactions with the facades can qualitatively show and describe how all people interact with the entry points. There can be an observed struggle with utilizing the stairways, bodies helping one another, and even as far as an individual traveling away from the rest of their group to enter through the ramps.
<br>
  <br>
The types of effects that would be literally to occur that appear to disconfirm my hypothesis:
No observations of struggles with using the facades of the buildings.
Personal accounts through interviews do not demonstrate struggles with entry points.
Participants feel very strongly about maintaining the ongoing preservation of the buildings. If this is so, I can challenge the conversation and get opinions on how they view the importance of accessibility to buildings. 
A higher collection of data that demonstrates little to no inconveniences with the buildings.

  Procedure
</div>
<div id="secondp">To begin, I will send out questionnaires to the residents of Oregon City to allow residents to become aware of my research project I will be conducting. As they will be made aware, they will also have the opportunity to submit as well as follow up on the questionnaires through interview setups. During this period, I am going to present the stimuli by first observing the buildings at a distance and study how they are interacted with to see which times of day they are most busiest and how they are used. Doing these things first will establish and settle in my presence around the buildings and area. During the observational period, I will write down where the main entry points are, if there are any struggles encountered, and how many times the ramps or backways are used by individuals. Afterwards, I will then begin introducing interviews into the procedure. I will be approaching individuals, introducing myself and my project to build a rapport and common ground with them, and then conduct my set of questions. 
<br>
<br>
The participant in the experiment will:
	Surveys:
	- Be encouraged to participate within the survey.
- Answer a series of questions about the research.
- Be encouraged to follow up with an interview, which is up to the participant.
	Interviews:
	- Build a common ground with me, the interviewer.
- Answer a series of questions about the research.
- Be encouraged to share personal accounts with accessibility issues.
 <br>
  <br>
<div class="areatostudy">
  Analysis
</div>
<div id="secondp">
  Results will be gathered anonymously and placed into a spreadsheet where they will be categorized. The descriptive, story-like data from interviews will be used as qualitative data and directly quoted from in the research during analysis. Other information can be converted into a graph showing the overall experiences that the participants endure. This information will be compared to gather an average experience of the buildings.
<br>
  <br>
The layout of the facades directly impacts accessibility and mobility for individuals.
Evidence through storytelling that describes moments in which there was a troublesome encounter with accessibility; this is not limited to stair-only facades â€“ it also includes having to take alternate routes or entering the building from a non-prominent side. 
Observed interactions with the facades show an observed struggle with utilizing the stairways, demonstrate bodies helping one another to get up into the building, and even as far as an individual traveling away from the rest of their group to enter through the ramps.
The majority of residents in oregon city collectively agree that the facades of the buildings need to undergo a change to follow ADA Guidelines that benefit the dis-abled identifying bodies. 
<br>

No observations of struggles with using the facades of the buildings.
Personal accounts through interviews do not demonstrate struggles with entry points.
Participants feel very strongly about maintaining the ongoing preservation of the buildings.
A higher collection of data that demonstrates little to no inconveniences with the buildings.
