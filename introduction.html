     <div class="firstp">The issue I am examining is centered around the topic of preserved historical buildings and the impacts that they hold on those who identify as disabled. This is done with regards to the location of ADA-accessible points and overall inaccessibility issues. This issue is significant to examine as today’s world charges towards the embodiment of evolutionary thinking that is attentive towards inclusiveness and equality for all humans.

Both historical and modern architects develop structures with experiential programs that are to be complimented and carried out by the human body – whether it be for the abled or dis-abled, though, is what needs to be addressed. Today, ADA accessibility is a requirement for all new structures being built. Architects have been designing their projects to be accessible to all, carrying out a form that is accepting and accessible to all bodies. The <a href="https://archello.com/project/virginia-g-piper-sport-and-fitness-center-for-persons-with-disabilities" target="_blank">Virginia G. Piper Sport and Fitness Center for Persons with Disabilities</a>, for example, is a sport center designed as an environment accessible for all humans to use and participate in with ease. Historical buildings, on the other hand, have followed a different code at their time. They embody a point in history that was oppressive, inconsiderate, and unsympathetic to those who do not fit in the definition of being able-bodied. The hierarchical organization, ornamentation, and design approaches towards both the facades and interiors of spaces discreetly exercised power directly onto individuals or to carry out the points of where society stood at the time.

<div class="areatostudy">Area to be Studied</div>
  
<p id="secondp">The general area I will be studying is accessibility within architecture. Accessibility is extremely important to architecture; not to forget, it is an architect’s responsibility to follow the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), which are ADA guidelines that they must comply with. This is necessary to comply with as not everybody experiences and interacts with space the same. The variance in human bodies calls for universal safety within buildings as they interact with them each and every day. Architects are the designers at hand to deliver experiences, shelters, and places to gather. With that said, most all buildings are made for human interaction; considering the needs of other beings is a large part of architectural design, and therefore it is important to address the facades of the pre-ADA guideline buildings.</p>
