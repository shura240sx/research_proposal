           My proposed research would lead to a very significant improvement over the original studies
as the issue I am examining is centered around ADA-accessible points in historical buildings and their overall inaccessibility issues. This issue is significant to examine as todayâ€™s world charges towards the embodiment of evolutionary thinking that is attentive towards inclusiveness and equality for all humans. This study will outline and define the human experience aspect of architecture, which is extremely important to address. The variance in human bodies calls for universal safety within buildings as they interact with them each and every day. Architects are the designers at hand to deliver experiences, shelters, and places to gather. With that said, most all buildings are made for human interaction; considering the needs of other beings is a large part of architectural design, and therefore it is important to address the humanities aspect that the facades of the pre-ADA guideline buildings have. This is a very fundable research, as it addresses a subject that is met with on a daily basis around the globe.
